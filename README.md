Simple Pokémon battle Game

One of my interactive web projects is a Pokémon battle game that utilizes a Pokémon API. 
In this game, players can select two Pokémon to battle against each other. Both Pokémon choose a move 
from a list of real moves provided by the API. The battle mechanics are designed so that the faster 
Pokémon attacks first, using the power of the chosen move to deal damage to the opponent. While I 
have not yet implemented all the mechanics from the original Pokémon games, I consider this version 
to be a solid foundation.
